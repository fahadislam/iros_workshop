\section{INTRODUCTION}
%1. What is the problem?
Consider the problem of a robot picking up objects from a conveyor belt and placing them into bins (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PR2}).
Similarly, consider a robot given the task of stock replenishment---moving in a supermarket and loading items from a cart it carries to half-empty shelves.
%2. Why is it relevant?
These problems are examples of repetitive tasks performed by (possibly highly articulated) robots in static environments where the start and target of each repetitive task is similar, yet not identical, to previous tasks.
Difference in the exact start and target position may be due to uncertainty in the environment (objects placed on different parts of the conveyor belt or in different orientation) or due to highly-similar tasks (objects placed in similar positions on a shelf).

%3. Why is it hard?
As the set of possible start and target locations may be large, caching pre-computed paths for all these queries in advance is unmanageable. 
Clearly, once a task is presented to the robot, it can compute a desired path online.
However, this may incur large online planning times that may be unacceptable in many settings.
For example, in our conveyor-belt setting, reducing the planning time immediately corresponds to faster unloading capabilities. 
Thus, a natural approach is to preprocess the environment in an offline phase to allow for fast planning times online.

%4. What have others done?
A natural approach to preprocess the environment is using the \textsf{PRM} algorithm~\cite{kavraki1996probabilistic}.
Once a a dense roadmap has been pre-computed, any query can be efficiently answered online by connecting the source and target to the roadmap. 
Query times can be significantly sped up by further preprocessing the roadmaps using landmarks~\cite{paden2017landmark}
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the a query can be connected to the roadmap as \textsf{PRM} only provides \emph{asymptotic} guarantees~\cite{KKL98}.
Furthermore, this connecting phase requires running a collision-detection algorithm which is typically considered the computational bottleneck in many motion-planning algorithms~\cite{L06}.

Recently, Lehner and  Albu{-}Sch{\"{a}}ffer~\cite{LA18} suggest the repetition roadmap to extend the \textsf{PRM} for the case of multiple highly-similar scenarios.
While there approach exhibits significant speedup in computation time, it still suffers from the previously-mentioned shortcomings.

A complementary approach to aggressively preprocess a given scenario is by minimizing collision-detection time.
However this requires designing robot-specific
circuitry~\cite{MFQSK16}
or limiting the approach to standard manipulators~\cite{YMILV18}.

An alternative approach is to precompute a set of complete paths into a library and given a query, attempt to match complete paths
from the library to the new query~\cite{berenson2012robot, jetchev2013fast}
%5. What's missing?

%6. What is our ONE key insight?
Our key insight is to combine a precomputed library~$\mathcal{L}$ of paths between \emph{several} start and target configurations together with a method to connect \emph{any} start and target configuration to a path in~$\mathcal{L}$ \emph{without} having to perform collision detection.
This insight allows us to provide \emph{provable bounds } on the time to solve motion-planning queries which are in the order of miliseconds for a seven DoF manipulator.

%7. How do we compare against the state of the art?
We evaluate our approach in simulation on the PR2 robot\footnote{http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PR2})
and show
{\color{blue} what do we show?}

% This template provides authors with most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of their papers. All standard paper components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference proceedings. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow.

\section{Algorithm Description}

\subsection{Problem Formulation and Assumptions}
We propose a multi-query motion planning algorithm which is well suited for the planning problems that are highly repetitive. More formally our framework makes the following assumptions about the nature of the planning problems.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The start configuration $s_{start}$ of the robot is fixed.
  \item The goal configuration $s_{goal}$ falls within a goal $\textit{region}$ $G$, which is a relatively small subset of the full configuration space of the robot. $G$ is defined as a region around some nominal goal configuration.
  \item A considerable amount of preprocessing time is provided.
  \item During the query phase the environment remains static. 
  \item We have access to a $\textit{weekly monotonic}$ heuristic function $h(s)$ defined as 

  \begin{center}
  $h(s) \geq \min\limits_{\forall s' \in Succs(s)} h(s') \quad \forall s,s' \in G$
  \end{center}
  Namely, for any state $s$ in $G$ one of its successors (also belonging to $G$) must have a heuristic value less than or equal to its heuristic value. This property should hold considering that all the edges in $G$ are traversable i.e. they have finite costs.
  % $G$ is defined as a 6-dimensional window around some nominal goal pose in the task space, $q = (\textit{x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw})$.
\end{enumerate}

With these assumptions on the planning queries, we establish strong theoretical properties on the planning efficiency.

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
